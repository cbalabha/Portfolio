# Recreating a Visual 
For this assignment I chose to critique the following visual of [The $80 Trillion World Economy in One Chart ](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/80-trillion-world-economy-one-chart/). 
I chose this visual because it contains useful content and seemed like a challenge. $80 Trillion is a huge amount and accurately portraying it in one chart is not easy. I also chose this visual because there is a lot it can improve upon. 
At first glance there are a lot of things wrong with this visual for me and I thought that because of this, recreating it could be easy. Another reason I chose this chart is because it has information that is not intuitive or obvious. Everyone knows the relative size of the economies of major countries, but it is difficult to understand what this means in the context of the world economy. 

# Journey to the new visualization
While doing my critique of this chart there were a couple of things that immediately stood out to me. 
1.) The circle shape was not useful and does not help the human eye percieve the total size of the world economy
2.) The ambiguous "blob" shapes were also not helpful, and the percentages were absolutely useless. 
3.) The size of the blobs were not proportionate to the values that they contained, as stated in the Good Charts Handbook this is a big deal. 
The points I listed above were merely my first impressions, but when considering a redesign I put a lot more thought into the visualization. I decided that my first change would be the format of the chart. Instead of a chart where size means nothing relative to the values listed on the graph, I wanted to use a chart format where the human eye could perceive difference in size easily. 

I decided the best way to do this would be a side-by-side bar graph. The bar graph I sketched for my wireframe had a bar for every country that mapped the GDP in trillions of dollars for that country. Bars were grouped by region so that it looked like several separate bar graphs on one axis. I colored the bars by region (all of asia was blue, all of africa was purple etc.) and labelled the bars with each country. I also included a title ( I used the same title as the original graphic) and a legend. I then asked two people for feedback on the wireframe. Their answers are as follows:

1.) Can you tell me what you think this is? 
Person A: A chart of countries by GDP
Person B: The countries with the highest GDP in the world

2.) Is there anything you find confusing?
A: Where is the number $80 Trillion coming from? It is in the title but I don't think all of the numbers add up to $80 Trillion. 
B: No, not really, it looks pretty straightforward. 

3.) Is there anything you would do differently?
A: I can see how high the GDPs are relative to other countries but it is hard to say which region is the highest contributer to the economy, I would find a way to include that. Maybe use a pie chart to show parts of a whole? I also don't like the "other countries" category. Also if you're going to use the value $80 Trillion in the title then you should make sure the math works out. 
B: It isn't really "one chart" anymore it looks like a lot of different charts, I would use a pie chart to put everything in one chart.

I thought this feedback was useful because it made me consider a lot of elements I hadn't thought of before, like the title and the effect that could have on an audience that has no context. I was able to consider this feedback and deliver a better final visual. 

#The final visualization

For my final visualization I chose to show a stacked bar chart instead of side-by-side bar charts. I believe the interactive component of this chart still allows users to discern which countries make up the highest and lowest ends of the world economy but it is a much clearer presentation of which regions contribute to the global economy the most. The bars are proportional to the numbers which allows people to have a much clearer understanding of the visual at a glance. I also changed the title and got rid of the $80 Trillion figure which was uninformative and confusing. I think the best part of this visual is how the color highlights the different countries when clicked on offering a clear understanding of what the original chart promised to deliver.
