# About me
My name is Chinmayee Balabhadrapatruni. I am a second year Master's student in Public Policy and Management at Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I am a part of the Telling Stories with Data course here and I am excited to learn more about how to present data in a manner that is engaging and straightforward without being misleading
After I graduate in May I will be joining IBM as a federal consultant where hopefully I can put my skills to practice. 

# What I hope to learn
As I mentioned before, I hope to learn how to make data insights engaging and fun, but still accurately convey important information. I hope this class helps me hone this skill!
