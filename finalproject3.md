# Part 3 of Final Project 

For the final version of my Shorthand website, I decided to use several different mediums to create the graphs to represent my data. This is because I wanted to learn all of the tools that we discussed in class. I created most of my graphs using Tableau in order to keep the interactive feature of the graphs, and then I used Flourish and Infogram to create the infographic and the other charts. My mood board that I included in part I of the final project helped inform a lot of my design decisions including the images that I wanted to use. I think the main thing that I learned is that although text can help provide context to a story, visuals are what make a presentation appealing. I used open-source sites for all of my visuals including Unsplash, Canva, and Shorthand itself. Additionally, I used Infogram to make a large infographic about food waste in America. I think varying between text and imagery helped me create a far more compelling story than writing a long narrative about food waste. 

The intended audience for my website is anyone who makes decisions regarding food in their households, rather than just be informative, I wanted my site to be engaging and persuasive and I think that the imagery allows for that. Anyone who has a few minutes can look through the site, learn new information and fulfill their call to action. My users also mentioned a need for a captivating website with a lot of visuals because people who are interested in reading a lot tend to seek out sources on their own. 

My project is a little different because along with the data sources I cited, I also created my own experiment and used my own data. Originally I was only going to measure food waste in my own home on a daily basis, but I realized that lifestyle can really impact how people eat, preserve, and shop for food. I enlisted the help of two of my friends and had them collect their food waste in a bag for a week and at the end of the week I weighed it using a small kitchen scale that I own. I noticed that weighing food made people even more aware of how much food that they were wasting, and I wanted to incorporate that difference into a graphic. These visualizations speak for themselves and it takes a big, global issue such as food waste and makes it more relatable for people.   I think that changing this small aspect of my data collection made my visualization a lot more interesting. I also used a Google form that people can fill out for my call to action. I thought that this would be a lot more tangible for users than redirecting them to more resources.
